# EDS223: Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing

This repository contains Melannie Moreno Rolón's in-class lab materials, scripts, and notes for **EDS 223: Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing** at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UC Santa Barbara.

## About the Course
EDS 223 introduces core methods in geospatial analysis and remote sensing, with an emphasis on applications in environmental data science. The course covers:
- Spatial data formats and structures
- Remote sensing data acquisition and interpretation
- Raster and vector analysis
- Geoprocessing workflows
- Applications to ecological and environmental problems

Labs are designed to provide hands-on experience using **R** and **RStudio** for spatial analysis.

## Repository Structure
- `labs/` — scripts and lab exercises
- `data/` — (local only, not tracked in GitHub) datasets used for exercises
- `outputs/` — figures, maps, and results generated from labs
- `docs/` — supplemental notes or write-ups

## Requirements
- R (version 4.4.0 or higher)
